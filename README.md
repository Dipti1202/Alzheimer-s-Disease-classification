# Alzheimer's Disease Classification
One of the most common medical conditions today, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), is a severe neurological condition that frequently strikes persons in their early 60s. Because portions of the patient’s brain’s neural networks freeze due to the illness, the patient experiences significant memory loss. There is no remedy for this enduring brain disorder. Therefore, early detection is necessary to arrest the progression of AD. Machine learning’s role in illness detection depends heavily on deep learning, which simulates the human brain’s neural network for early AD identification. The DenseNet dense-block idea, conv2D layers connected via dense block layers, and maxPooling are used in the CNN model proposed in this paper. The dataset utilized for categorization includes the categories of Mild Demented, Non-Demented, Very Mild Demented, and Moderate Demented. The model’s training uses an Adam optimizer and a categorical cross-entropy loss function. With only a few parameters for multi-classification and accuracy rates and F1 score of 99.36% and 99%, respectively, the suggested approach outperforms previous models. The suggested approach may facilitate early AD diagnosis, permit prompt therapy, and increase the understanding of neurodegenerative diseases.
